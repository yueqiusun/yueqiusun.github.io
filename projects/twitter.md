•	Developed a bag of words model to detect and classify hate speech and offensive speech on Twitter to help monitor and filter out extreme tweets more efficiently based on the model. 
•	Applied our classiﬁcation model to real world data by drawing thousands of tweets through Twitter API. Successfully filtered out over 95% of the benign class and retrieve over 60% of the tweets that contain hate language.
