In this paper, we propose to use deep learning to establish a mapping between the 3D galaxy distribution in hydrodynamic simulations and its underlying dark matter distribution. One of the major challenges in this pursuit is the very high sparsity in the predicted galaxy distribution. To this end, we develop a two-phase convolutional neural network architecture to generate fast galaxy catalogues, and compare our results against a standard cosmological technique. We find that our proposed approach either outperforms or is competitive with traditional cosmological techniques. Compared to the common methods used in cosmology, our approach also provides a nice trade-off between time-consumption (comparable to fastest benchmark in the literature) and the quality and accuracy of the predicted simulation. In combination with current and upcoming data from cosmological observations, our method has the potential to answer fundamental questions about our Universe with the highest accuracy.
