"Optimization of Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)" is a project that (aims to provide data-driven guidence to the physicians who examine patients with RNS devices) or (propose to help explore the optimzal settings for the electrical stimulation of the RNS device). We built a reliable classifier that classifier clinical performance based on available background EEG data and examine the neural science intuition behind the machine learning model. Also, we investigate how sleep influence the predicting accuracy of the classifier.




Backgroung
======
Some patients with refractory epilepsy are implanted with a responsive neurostimulation device (RNS NeuroPace, Inc., Mountain View, CA).  The RNS is an FDA-approved device which delivers brief pulses of electrical stimulation upon detection of abnormal EEG patterns to terminate seizures. Physicians program RNS detection and stimulation parameters to potentially reduce seizure duration and frequency. Current practice is empirically driven, and physicians are limited by a lack of evidence for guiding stimulation settings.  A data-driven approach could help physicians reach optimal therapeutic stimulation parameters more quickly, and avoid seizure exacerbation.
