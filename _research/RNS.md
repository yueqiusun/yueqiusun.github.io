Overview
======
"Optimization of Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)" is a project that (aims to provide data-driven guidence to the physicians who examine patients with RNS devices) or (propose to help explore the optimzal settings for the electrical stimulation of the RNS device). We built a reliable classifier that classifier clinical performance based on available background EEG data and examine the neural science intuition behind the machine learning model. Also, we investigate how sleep influence the predicting accuracy of the classifier.

Led the project "Optimization of Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS) Therapy through Data Mining Approaches". Built reliable machine learning classifiers based on background EEG patterns and CNN image classifiers based on spectrogram to assess the efficacy of RNS parameter adjustments.

Examined long-term neuromodulatory effects of chronic electrical stimulation. Assessed the role of long episode duration as a biomarker of acute response to electrical stimulation.
