I am a graduate student in the Center of Data Science department at NYU, working with Prof. Anli Liu, Prof. Shirley Ho, and postdoc fellow Xiaojing Wu. My research interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Mining. Specially, I am interested in conducting interdisciplinary research across Healthcare, Astrology and signal processing using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. 


I am a graduate student in the GRAIL lab of the Computer Science and Engineering Department at the University of Washington, working with Prof. Steven Seitz and Prof. Jason Lawrence. My research interests include virtual/augmented reality, computer vision and graphics. My focus now is more in virtual/augmented reality which combines vision and graphics in an interested way while I did research on stereo matching in BCMI lab at Shanghai Jiao Tong University with advisor Prof. Hongtao Lu and on deep learning in National Univerity of Singapore with advisor Prof. Shuicheng Yan as an undergrad.
I am a PhD student of in the Institute for Theoretical Computer Science in the Technical University of Graz in Austria. Under the supervision of Professor Wolfgang Maass, I investigate theoretical models and simulation of neural networks to reveal principles of brain computation. As a curious person I am always eager to discover about the wonders of Nature and human societies, and I am grateful to learn about it with the best experts through collaborative research projects. On the long term, I hope that my research will contribute to clinical progress and the development of machine intelligence that respect human morals.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from a competitve double-master of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning (at ENSTA Paristech and ENS Paris-Saclay). In this context I completed various lab rotations, one of which was driven by my passion for music, and it got me to study Psychoacoustics and Neuroscience. Ever since, I questioned myself about the neural mechanisms behind thoughts and perceptions.
