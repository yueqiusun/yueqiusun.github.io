Summary
======
•	Proposed an automated outlier detection scheme that implemented MapReduce Attribute Value Frequency algorithm(AVF) and k-means clustering to expose outliers in numerical, categorical or hybrid datasets. Detected outliers for 50 random dataset without assuming any domain knowledge using Hadoop and Pyspark.
•	Compared the performance for AVF implemented in Spark and MR-AVF(MR paradigm based AVF). Showed that MR-AVF had a much better scaling property and only took O(1) memory.
