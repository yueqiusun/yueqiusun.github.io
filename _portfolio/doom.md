[Playing DOOM with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://yueqiusun.github.io/files/1005poster.pdf)<br/>

Deep reinforcement learning has been widely used in video game playing. In thisproject, we trained agents to play scenario â€™search and hitâ€™ and scenario â€™healthgatheringâ€™ in game DOOM with deep reinforcement learning model including DeepQ Learning with prioritized experience replay and policy gradient. Additionallywe implemented and evaluated the performance of the agents that were trainedwith several different exploration strategies including random policy,-greedy, andBoltzmann policy.To conclude, the agent for the â€™search and hitâ€™ scenario achieved almost perfectperformance, and the agent for the â€™health gatheringâ€™ scenario performed far betterthan the baseline model. We also conclude that randomness in exploration policyenables agents to gather more information about the environment and is importantin training agents.
