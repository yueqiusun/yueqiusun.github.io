Our objective is to build a model based on implicit feedback from a userâ€™s past behaviour as well as similar decisions made by other users to predict songs that the user may have interest in, which is a collaborative filtering technique. To be more specific, we want to predict the preference of each user to each song, and
thus to make recommendations to each user with a ranked list of songs.
<!-- 
When I was building a music recommendation system based on implicit feedback using collaborative filtering methods, the optimization for the machine learning model will take too much time if I include every user in the data set in the model. Without significant loss of accuracy, I speed up predicting the preference by applying a much simpler model(popularity model) to predict preference for the user who have listened less than 20 songs. And I apply the collaborative filtering method to the other users.  -->
